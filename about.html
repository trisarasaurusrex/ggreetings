        <h1 class="mission">Why we do what we do..</h1>

        <h2 style="text-align: center;">
            I'm a mom of 3, and the most important lesson I want my children to learn
                is to be kind and help others in need. We started this as a homeschool project
                in 2022 as something we could do together as a family. If you or someone you know
                could use a little lifting up and faith in your life, please head over to the Greetings link in the navigation bar up top. <br>
<br>
            "Our ministry is dedicated to spreading love, compassion, and hope to individuals in need.
            Rooted in faith, we strive to serve others with humility and kindness.
            Through our actions, we aim to inspire faith, and make a positive impact on the world around us."</h2>
